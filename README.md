## General Information
You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
 
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
● Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan
default. Maybe they can another tenure category which may cater to intermediatory customers.
● Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information
from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
● ‘UT’, ‘WY’, ‘AK’ have high defaulters. Further analysis should be done when an application request comes from those states.
● Small business loans are defaulted more. A proper plan should be put in place to stop/reduce the loan amount.
● Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved
loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more
than 12000.
● People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a
bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower.
Applicants with lower incomes should not be provided high amount of loans.
Applicants with lower incomes should be provided loans with less interest rates.
